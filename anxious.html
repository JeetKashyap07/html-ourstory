    <h2>Breathe, baby. I‚Äôm right here </h2>
    <p>if u‚Äôre readin this, it means ur mind‚Äôs doin that thing again‚Äî
        runnin too fast, thinkin too much, makin everything feel heavier than it really is.
        so first things first:
        breathe.
        right here with me.
        inhale slow‚Ä¶ hold it‚Ä¶ now let it out.
        
        you‚Äôre okay.
        you are.
        even if ur brain‚Äôs tryin to convince u otherwise.
        
        i know it‚Äôs scary sometimes, when u can‚Äôt explain why you feel off.
        when everything feels like it‚Äôs pressin down nd u can‚Äôt quite catch your breath.
        but you‚Äôre not broken. you‚Äôre not weak.
        you‚Äôre just human‚Äînd it‚Äôs okay to have moments like this.
        
        i wish i could be there right now to hold your hand,
        to pull u close nd say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre safe.‚Äù
        because with me, you always are.
        
        let the world slow down for a sec.
        you don‚Äôt have to solve everything.
        you don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
        you don‚Äôt even have to be okay all the time.
        
        you jus have to be here.
        with me.
        right now.
        nd that‚Äôs enough.
        
        you‚Äôre loved, even in the chaos.
        you‚Äôre held, even when you feel like you‚Äôre fallin.
        you‚Äôre not alone‚Äînot ever.
        
        we‚Äôll get through this wave.
        together.
        
        ‚Äì yours, always calm for you.
