        <b>“Our Forever Starts Now”</b><br>
        I know this distance sucks. I know it hurts, and sometimes it feels like time is moving too slow. But baby girl, I swear to you — one day, we’ll wake up next to each other and smile because we made it.<br><br>
        I promise to never let go, no matter how tough life gets.<br>
        I promise to make you laugh, even through tears.<br>
        I promise to never stop choosing you — even on days when we’re tired, busy, or annoyed.<br><br>
        And most of all, I promise this:<br>
        One day, we’ll close this distance.<br>
        One day, this “long distance” will just be a story we tell.<br>
        One day, I’ll hug you so tight you’ll forget how it felt to miss me.<br><br>
        Until then, I’ll love you across every mile, every second, every heartbeat.<br><br>
        You + Me = Always & Forever. <br><br>

    <h2>When We’re Finally Together…</h2>
    <p>
        I imagine waking up to your sleepy face. I imagine cooking with you and fighting over who messed up the chai ya fir coffee. I imagine date nights where we don’t need to hang up — because you’re finally here.<br><br>
        I imagine holding your hand in silence and still feeling heard.<br>
        I imagine us sitting on rooftops, laughing till our stomachs hurt.<br><br>
        I imagine coming home to you. Every day. Always.<br><br>
        One day, meri jaan… all of this will be real.<br><br>
        And we’ll smile, remembering this paper — remembering how much we held on — and how it was so worth it.<br><br>
        Because you… are worth <b>everything.</b>
