    <h2>Hey, my love ü•∫</h2>
    <p>i know you‚Äôre sad right now.
        i wish i could be there‚Äîreally be there‚Äî
        to pull you close, kiss your forehead, hold u tight 'til u feel safe again.
        
        i hate that u feel like this.
        i hate that i‚Äôm not there to stop the tears or calm the storm in ur chest.
        but even if i‚Äôm not there physically, please know i‚Äôm with you.
        always. in every heartbeat, in every quiet moment. in every part of you that still believes in ‚Äúus.‚Äù
        
        you don‚Äôt have to be okay all the time.
        you don‚Äôt have to smile when u feel like cryin.
        it‚Äôs okay to fall apart a little. i‚Äôll help u pick up the pieces.
        i will be there. maybe not this second, but soon.
        nd when i am, we‚Äôll sit in the quiet together, no words needed.
        jus u. me. nd all the love in between.
        
        so take a breath, baby.
        for me.
        feel it fill u up.
        feel how strong u are, even when u don‚Äôt feel strong.
        
        i miss you so much it aches.
        but even more than missin you‚ÄîI love you.
        deeply. truly. all the way.
        
        you‚Äôre not alone.
        not now.
        not ever.üíó</p>
