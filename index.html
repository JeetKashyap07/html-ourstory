      Happy 5 Months, Meri Pyaari Rasgulla ❤️<br>
      Pata bhi nahi chala kab 5 mahine beet gaye…<br>
      Bas tumhari baaton mein, hasi mein, aur pyaar mein khud ko itna kho diya ki waqt ka ehsaas hi nahi raha.<br>
      Tumhari har ek baat… tumhari vo aankhon wali khamoshi, vo hasi jo seedha dil ko choo jaati hai… sab kuch jaadu sa lagta hai.<br>
      Rasgulla, tum naam hi nahi ho—tum ek ehsaas ho, meri zindagi ki sabse pyari mithaas.<br>
      Jab se tum mili ho, har cheez mein ek naya rang aa gaya hai.<br>
      Tumhara hona mere liye sirf comfort nahi… vo ek jagah hai jahan main khud ko sabse zyada apna mehsoos karta hoon. <br>
      5 mahine mein humne sirf tumse pyaar nahi kiya…<br>
      tumhari har ek baat se, har ek mood se, har ek khamoshi se, har ek paagalpan se mohabbat kar li.<br>
      Tumhare bina sab kuch adhoora lagta hai.<br>
      Aur jab tum saath hoti ho, toh har din ek nayi kahani ban jaata hai… ek aisi kahani jisme sirf tum ho, nd tumhara yeh pagal deewana.<br>
      Hume tumse roz thoda aur pyaar ho jaata hai.<br>
      Aur yeh pyaar kabhi kam nahi hoga… na kal, na kisi aur janam mein. Tum ho toh sab kuch hai.<br><br>
      <b>Happy 5 Months, meri Rasgulla.</b><br>
      Tere saath har lamha special hai, par yeh 5 mahine toh meri zindagi ke sabse khoobsurat chapters ban gaye hain.<br><br>
      Hamesha tumhara,<br>
      <b>Jeet</b>

    <h2>Our Promise to Each Other</h2>
    <p>
      Together, no matter how far apart we are, our love is strong enough to conquer any distance. I promise that one day, no matter where life takes us, we will be together. This long-distance journey is just a chapter in our story, not the whole book. Every day, we are writing the most beautiful story, and our future together will be nothing short of magical. I can't wait for the day when we don't have to say ttyl anymore.<br><br>
      Always and forever,my gillu. I will always be here, loving you, waiting for that day when we’re no longer apart. ❤️

    <h2>Our Journey Together</h2>
    <p>
      Five months ago, we took the first step in a journey that would change our lives forever. Since then, every day has been an adventure—learning more about each other, creating memories, and falling deeper in love. I am so grateful for your presence in my life.<br><br>
      From the way you laugh to the way you care for me, everything about you makes my heart skip a beat. There are so many things I can’t wait to experience with you, but for now, I’ll cherish everything we’ve already had.<br><br>
      XXXXX (Talk about special moments—like your first date, or a memory that stands out to you).

    <p>
      Baby girl,<br>
      The first picture… it holds the moment my heart slipped quietly into love with you — <b>8th December 2023</b> — the day my soul whispered, "she’s the one."
      I was loving you from a distance, quietly, deeply — ek tarfa pyaar. And exactly a year later, on <b>8th December 2024</b>, we weren’t just two people anymore, we were us. That love? I’ll hold onto it forever.<br><br>
      The second picture — <b>14th November 2024 </b>— the day I planned to propose… but couldn’t. My hands shook, my courage failed, but my heart was already yours. When I see that photo, I still ask myself: “How did I get a girl this perfect?”
      Look at you. Then look at me. I must’ve done something right in this life — or maybe a thousand lives before — to deserve you.<br><br>
      And the third picture — <b>Farewell 2024-25</b> — my heart was heavy. That day felt like an ending I wasn’t ready for. "Ab kab milenge?" 
      was the only thing echoing in my head. But damn, we looked fire together that day. You and me? We belong. Always.<br><br>
      <b>I don’t just love you. I want forever with you.</b>

    <h2>Our Future Together</h2>
    <p>
      When I think about the future, I don’t see a place.<br>
      I see you.<br>
      In every version of tomorrow, it’s your hand I’m holding.<br>
      Your smile greeting me after long days.<br>
      Your sleepy voice calling me home.<br><br>

      We’ll build a life full of midnight maggi and morning cuddles,<br>
      of shared playlists, inside jokes, and stolen hoodies you still won’t take.<br>
      A life where every fight ends with forehead kisses<br>
      and every silence is filled with comfort, not distance.<br><br>

      I want us chasing dreams together —<br>
      you glowing in your world,<br>
      me cheering you on like the proudest man alive.<br>
      Maybe a small home filled with laughter,<br>
      or a big one filled with memories.<br>
      Maybe a dog. Maybe a hundred polaroids on the fridge.<br>
      Definitely, us. Always us.<br><br>

      I don’t want a perfect life.<br>
      I want a real one.<br>
      With you in every chapter.<br>
      Because wherever life takes us,<br>
      you will always be my favorite place to come back to.<br><br>

      Forever sounds beautiful when it’s with you.<br>
      <b>— Mera pyaar, meri jaan, meri future 🤍</b>
