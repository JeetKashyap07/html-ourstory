    <h2>You are strong, baby 💪</h2>
    <p>i know things feel hard right now.
        maybe everything’s piling up. maybe u’re tired in ways u don’t even know how to explain.
        but i need you to remember this:
        
        you’ve got this.
        no, seriously—u do.
        u’re stronger than u think, even when u feel like crumbling.
        i’ve seen the way you fight through things, the way u care, the way u push forward even when no one’s cheering.
        
        but guess what?
        I’m cheering.
        loudly.
        every single time.
        
        u’re not alone in this.
        i believe in you—fully, without doubt.
        nd when u forget how amazing you are, i’ll be the one to remind you.
        you’re brilliant. capable. beautiful. powerful.
        the world might try to dim that light sometimes—but it can’t touch what’s inside you.
        
        so get up.
        breathe.
        take it one tiny step at a time.
        nd if today’s hard, that’s okay.
        i’m proud of u jus for tryin.
        for being.
        
        whatever storm you’re facin—i’m right here.
        your biggest fan.
        your soft place to fall.
        your forever hype squad.
        
        go win today, even if it’s jus by surviving it.
        you’re never doing this alone.
        
        – with all my love, always.💘</p>
