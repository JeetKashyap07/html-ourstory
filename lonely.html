    <h2>You‚Äôre not alone, baby ü§ç</h2>
    <p>i know right now everything feels quiet in the worst way.
        like the kind of quiet that makes ur chest feel empty, like the world‚Äôs forgotten how to reach you.
        but it hasn‚Äôt.
        I haven‚Äôt.
        
        i‚Äôm here.
        not just as a name on ur phone.
        not just as someone u love.
        but as a presence that never leaves, even when life tries to pull us apart.
        u‚Äôre never really alone‚Äînot when my heart beats for you.
        
        i wish i could teleport to you right now.
        slide into bed next to u, wrap my arms around you, nd say nothin‚Äîjus stay.
        jus be there.
        but since i can‚Äôt, let this be my voice in ur head:
        ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not alone. not now. not ever. i love you. i choose you.‚Äù
        
        ur laugh lives in my memory.
        ur smile still lights up all the dark corners of my day.
        nd even when you feel like no one sees u‚Äîi do.
        i always do.
        
        u‚Äôre not too much. not a burden.
        u‚Äôre someone i wanna love through everything, even the lonely hours.
        
        so when it gets too quiet‚Äî
        close ur eyes.
        breathe.
        nd feel me right there beside you.
        
        forever yours,
        even in the silence.üíå</p>
